# Clicker Heroes Script

> I developed this script to automatically play and improve my heroes because the game is repetitive and just about clicking.

### Features

- A fancy interface.
- Attack the enemies.
- Travel to the next world/island automatically.
- Register how many times you attacked and traveled.
- Capture the screen and know exactly how much coins you had at the beginning of the execution.

## üé≤ Prerequisites

- Change the code magic numbers for your screen size (i build it with a laptop, so 1366x768).
  - Use `pyautogui.position` to get x and y coordinates;
  - Use `pyautogui.displayMousePosition` to get x, y and rgb colors.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è How to download and use it in your game

1. Open the game Clicker Heroes
2. Run the script

```bash
python src/clickerheroes.py # if you have python2, you should run py or python3 instead
```
